# UNDERTALE RE-IMAGINED

So, what is this?, well this is a **Enchanted** or better call a **Upgrade** for **UNDERTALE** that add someone mechanics from **DELTARUNE**.

This Fan-Game is based on a decompile version of UNDERTALE (the demo ones).



## Goals

- Fix the engine.
  - Yes, you read right, although the port is "complete" from GM8 > GMS something will be broke
- Port someone features from retail UNDERTALE.
- Add someone mechanics from DELTARUNE.
- And more coming in the future.
- Port the engine to GMS2
  - Yes, that means fix the engine again, **sigh**, but hey its not bad at leas for me now that my PC don't support GMS2, but in exchanged i can get animated tiles, and other stuffs.
- Toggle able colored sprites
  - So, you don't need to edit the game's .win file  



## What is Done So Far?

Literally, nothing, well that is not true the engine is "semi-working" an when i finish working on the engine, then i will start working on the features.
