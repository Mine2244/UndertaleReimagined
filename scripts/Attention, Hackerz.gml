//It's cool that you like my game this much.

//Yes, I know these are easy to decompile... You can edit Yume Nikki and OFF in RPG Maker as well. This isn't really any different.

//My only wish is that you don't spoil the game for anyone else.
//Wait for everyone to discover the secrets in here by themselves.
//Otherwise, there will be no replay value :(

//I'd also appreciate it if you held off on significant modifications before the full game is released.
//I'll most likely be updating some things about the game that might make it interesting to play with.

//I'll be watching...

//Ha ha ha.
